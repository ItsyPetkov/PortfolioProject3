# Coffee Sales Intelligence Dashboard – Product, Market & Performance Optimization Study

This portfolio project is based on coffee sales data provided by a local retailer. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed on transactional data to isolate and understand specific trends and patterns that support strategic decision-making, revenue optimisation, and sustainable business growth. This project is produced in its entirety solely using MS Excel.

## Target User: Business Owner/Potential Stakeholders

This analysis is designed for people looking to enter the coffee retail market or to expand their business by investigating sales data. It provides actionable insights such as buying behaviour, high-volume vs. high-value comparison, loyalty program effectiveness, price-volume tradeoffs, growth trends and seasonal coffee paterns.

## Data Analysis Framework

<!-- This is a project aiming to develop a pipeline of data pre-processing and analysis within Excel. It consists of two different dataset and thus two different dashboards are created (one is begginer-friendly and the other demonstrates more advanced concepts)

Topics that are covered in this exploration include:

1.Pivot Tables

2.Functions and formulae -> MIN(), MAX(), SUM(), POW(), SQRT(), AVG(), IF(), IFS(), LEN(), LEFT(), RIGHT(), TEXT(), TRIM(),
CONCATENATE(), SUBSTITUTE(), SUMIF(), SUMIFS(), COUNT(), COUNTIF(), COUNTSIFS(), DAYS(), MONTHS(), YEARS(), NETWORKDAYS(),
UPPER(), LOWER(), PROPER(), INDEX()

3.XLOOKUP and VLOOKUP

4.Conditional Formatting

5.Charts

6.Data Cleaning in Excel
